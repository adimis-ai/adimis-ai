Please delve into my repositories to witness firsthand how I'm pushing the boundaries of technology.

## Areas of Expertise

My core competencies encompass the development of AI solutions using tools such as Langchain, Llamaindex, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and HuggingFace Transformers. Additionally, I have a profound understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. On the other end of the spectrum, I possess proficiency in full-stack development, encompassing frontend technologies like ReactJs and Angular, as well as backend technologies such as NodeJs, ExpressJs, NestJs, FastAPI, and Flask. For database management, I work with PostgreSql and MySQL for relational databases and MongoDB for non-relational databases.
